= Introduction

Typst is a versatile and powerful tool for creating well-structured and beautifully formatted documents, from technical reports to academic papers. This guide provides a detailed overview of using Typst, highlighting its key features, including basic formatting, embedding code blocks, and utilizing specialized functions for enhanced document design.

= Basic Formatting

#let typst-preview(output, typst-code) = table(
  columns: 2,
  fill: (_, row) => if row == 0 { blue } else { white },
  align: (_, row) => if row == 0 { center } else { horizon + left },
  text(fill: white, weight: "bold", "Typst Code"), text(fill: white, weight: "bold", "Output"),
  align(horizon, box(width: 100%, typst-code)),
  box(width: 100%)[
    #set heading(numbering: "i.", outlined: false)
    #output
  ],
)

- *Headings and Subheadings:* Create headings by typing = followed by your heading text. Increase the number of `=` signs for subheadings, indicating their level within the document structure.

- *Emphasizing Text:* Use `_underscores_` to _italicize words or phrases_, adding emphasis where needed.

- *Lists:* Generate ordered lists with `+` and unordered lists with `-`. Indent lists for sub-items, creating a hierarchical structure.

#typst-preview[
  = Main Heading
  _This_ is a *level 1* heading.

  == Subheading
  + This is an ordered list.
  + It can contain multiple items.
][```typ
  = Main Heading
  _This_ is a *level 1* heading.

  == Subheading
  + This is an ordered list.
  + It can contain multiple items.
  ```]

#weakbreak

= Advanced Elements

== Figures
Inserting figures and code blocks into your Typst document enhances its informational depth. When specifying a `caption` for a figure, the template will automatically generate a list of figures, making it easy to navigate your document.

/ Note: When using "ieee" Sorting for bibliography, the sources for figures will be evaluated before the text. To prevent "false sorting", you can use `#caption_with_source("Text", [@source])` instead. This will display the caption in outlines without source and will the source evaluate at the time the figure is displayed

=== Image Figures
#typst-preview(
  figure(
    image("assets/SAP-Logo.svg"),
    caption: "SAP Logo",
  ),
)[```typ
  #figure(
    image("assets/SAP-Logo.svg"),
    caption: "SAP Logo"
  )
  ```]

=== Code Snippets:

#typst-preview(
  codefigure(caption: "My Code")[```rust
    fn main() {
      println!("Hello World!");
    }
    ```],
  raw(read("assets/example-code.typ"), block: true, lang: "typ"),
)

/ Note: You can also provide custom syntax (`.sublime-syntax`) files for code highlighting. The template already includes a syntax file for CDS, so you can use the `cds` language in your code blocks.

#weakbreak

== Math
The math syntax is a loose interpretation of LaTeX, allowing you to create complex mathematical equations with ease.
See #link("https://typst.app/docs/reference/math/", "the Typst documentation") for a detailed overview of the math syntax.

#typst-preview[
  $
    sum_(k=0)^n k
    &= 1 + ... + n \
    &= (n(n+1)) / 2
  $
][```typ
  $ sum_(k=0)^n k
      &= 1 + ... + n \
      &= (n(n+1)) / 2 $
  ```]

== Quotes

#typst-preview[
  #quote[
    "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
    _\~ Franklin D. Roosevelt_
  ]
][```typ
  #quote[
    "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
    _\~ Franklin D. Roosevelt_
  ]
  ```]

== Notes

#typst-preview[
  #note[
    This is a note box, highlighting important information.
  ]
][```typ
  #note[
    This is a note box, highlighting important information.
  ]
  ```]

= References and Citations

== Local Elements
You can reference local elements like figures, code blocks, and sections using the `ref()` function. You can also use the synax sugar `<ref>` to define and `@<ref>` to reference references.

#typst-preview[
  = Important Section <section-1>
  Some important text

  = Other Section
  More important text, just like @section-1
][```typ
  = Section 1 <section-1>
  Some important text

  = Section 2
  More important text, just like @section-1
  ```]

== Code Blocks
If you use the provided `codefigure` function, you can specify a reference name via the `reference` parameter. This allows you to reference the code block later in the document.

#typst-preview(
  [#codefigure(
      caption: "Code w/ Ref",
      reference: "my-rust-code",
    )[```rust
      fn main() {
        panic!("Hilfe!");
      }
      ```]

    Look at my code in @my-rust-code!],
  raw(read("assets/example-code-2.typ"), block: true, lang: "typ"),
)

#weakbreak

== Bibliography
Typst supports references to external sources, such as books, articles, and websites. You can include a `.yaml` or `.bib` file with your references and use the `cite()` function to reference them in your document. Again, you can use the same syntax sugar `@<ref>` to cite.

#typst-preview[
  #quote[
    Just Because You're Allowed To Use Magic Now Does Not Mean You Have To Whip Your Wands Out For Everything! @harry
    _\~ Molly Weasley_
  ]
][```typ
  #quote[
    Just Because [...] Whip Your Wands Out For Everything! @harry
    _\~ Molly Weasley_
  ]
  ```]

== Acronyms
Specify acronyms in the project configuration to use them throughout your document. You can use the `@acr` function to reference acronyms and the `@acr:pl` function to reference their plural form.

#typst-preview[
  #quote[
    I don't understand @NN or @NN:pl and never will understand.
    _\~ Me_
  ]
][```typ
  #quote[
    I don't understand @NN or @NN:pl and never will.
    _\~ Me_
  ]
  ```
]

On the first usage, the full form of the acronym is displayed, and on subsequent usages, only the acronym is shown.

= Conclusion
Happy writing with Typst! If you have any questions, open an issue :)
